### Meeting Planning/Outline
##### Meeting with Chad
- Went over our team page, name, values, brand
- Chad said good job to our vids
- Go over team contract and explain our team contract
- Contract edits:
  - Write/layout course of action when someone can't do tasks on time
  - Detailed expectations
  - Need to be more explicit and lay things out more better
- Keep in mind for roles:
  - What are the distinctions between the roles?
  - For example: do we want to have a designated QA person or people write unit tests for their own code etc.
     


### Future roadmap:
 - need to meet up as team to discuss high level design
   - what problem are we solving
   - who's our users
 - have an assignment that will be released
