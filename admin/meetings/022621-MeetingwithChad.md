## Notes

### How are notes being taken?
(Ellie) Usually standup leaders will take notes for their assigned day. Each standupmeeting also incorporates an agenda of what they are going to do that following day.

### How is Documentation?
We are manually inputing the js docs as we did not figure out how to automate it just yet. 
(Chad) make sure to maintain consistency for ex. return parameters and etc. 

What changes are we making to team organization and roadmap?
(Ellie) We have any huge changes in team organization. We have prioritized certain tasks. For ex. features and what users would appreciate. Like the background and the timer counter.
We are going to display an icecube to display the amount of pomo's finished. 
(Chad) We arent expecting all teams to have the exact same features, but we encourage other teams to be inspired by one another.
We are focusing on documentation and testing. 

(Going over the stretch sprint with Chad)

Look into ES6 for exports for the jest test files so we can incorporate Cypress testing in the future.

What are the plans for the rest of the term?
(Ellie) We have a list of things that we want to do and we are taking along the high priority ones.

What can we realistically get done by the end of the term?

We expect a lot of unit test and E2E tests to be pretty similar. A manual test in which we expect a user to (try to break?) our website.
(String templating) It is by no means essential and is something worth looking up for JS which allows you to do multiline strings.
