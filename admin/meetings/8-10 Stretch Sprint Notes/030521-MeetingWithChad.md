Adding in pomo counter indicators.
From the feedback from Wednesday we made some changes to how pomos alternate by making the beginning of each stage to be start manually. 
Suggestion to add the tag of the current tab the user is on. 

### Update on testing and documentation
  issues with yml file and having to manually generate in the terminal and push it afterwards. 
  
  
### Plans for week 10
Not doing new features. Doing testing, documentation, and fixing bugs. 

Concerns:
  Make sure to stay on top of the tasks that people are assigned. 
  Apply some styling on the tabs to deemphasize them so they dont look like navigation tabs. To make it clear to the user that this is a sequential progression.
  Make to have a good amount of unit tests and cypress tests. To test the core functionality of the app. In our case, really make sure that the state is being mutated in a way that
  when calling functions will change the timer state properly. 
  Architecture diagrams are updated, recording meeting notes, and testing is fluid.
