### Main Frame
- What problem are we solving, essential features, additional features, everything on the Miro board

### User Centered Thinking
- Some user personas
  - We have no clue what we're doing with this one actually

### Project Roadmap
- More of just an overview of what we are going to do.

## Suggestions
- Continue to flesh on what we have so far
- Different types of students you can typify in user personas
- Try to differentiate between personas and user stories

### Difference Between Personas and User Stories
- Persona is a specific audience of users. It should be fairly targeted, something you can put a label on. Differentiating between something like classification, (undergrad vs grad), (freshman vs seniors). Goals (internship vs industry). Having these ideas in mind helps us shape the scenarios of the users using this app. A persona is not a scenario.
- User stories would be the situation the person gets themselves into

### How Does the Audience Inform the Problem?
- The cascade of influences is that the audience informs the problem, and the problem informs the features, and the desired features inform the roadmap
- The problem you are trying to solve should directly proceed from your audience. They do influence each other in a sense, but if you are targeting students, what are problems a student would have. What features would you need to include to meet those needs?
- Now that we know our high-level problem, we need to define it more on a lower level 

### Umm, it's week 4 already and we haven't done anything
- Yeah, just go with the flow and follow instructions. Don't worry too much about the final polished product. 

### UI/UX?
- Basically diagrams, and rough UI mockups
- Wireframes are a bit more detailed
- You can do these in Draw.io or Figma or something like that

### Think About Time
- WE HAVE NO TIME!! (basically)
- We might only finish our MVP

### Market Repo
- What features would you really use?
- What feathers can we feasibly implement?
- What is our reasoning for adding whatever extra features?
- Market research

## ToDo:
- Market research: explore existing apps and websites.
  - What works? What doesn't?
- Flesh out brainstorming docs
  - Split up to assign brainstorming
