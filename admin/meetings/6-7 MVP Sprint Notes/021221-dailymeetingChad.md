## Unit-Testing
github actions is setup that will check the javascript code. (Whoever writes the javascript will write their own test.js)
It will indicate however many test cases have passed. 

We first push to the dev branch, then it will be checked through the test branch, if it succeeds this it will then proceed to the main branch.

(Chad) When do the unit tests get written?
The unit tests will occur in the test branch. 

What happens in the scenario when 2+ people write javascript code and try to merge into the dev branch?
Create a standardized system for handling these types of conflicts.

## Documentation
Whoever writes their code to write their own documentation and to update the ADR with their respective changes.
