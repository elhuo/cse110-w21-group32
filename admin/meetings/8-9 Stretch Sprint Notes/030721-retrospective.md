Overall, our team felt great about our progress and how our pomo is coming along. I think our biggestt issue for this previous sprint was we couldn't keep up with who was doing what and we were a little burnt out because it's week 8 & 9 so hard to keep up with each other. But apart from that, our team felt great about everything else and our progress.

### Mad, Sad, Glad

- The topic in Mad, Sad, Glad that we voted on most was that the Pomo looks good, which shows that
  we believe that we are making good progress on our project.
- The second most voted ones were that communication is key and that we are glad that we don't have any
  more labs and review quizzes. No more labs and review quizzes freed up a lot of time for us and
  allowed us to get other work done. Communication is something that we feel we need to improve on,
  which we can do by communicating more through slack.
- Something that we were mad about was that procrastination is an issue for us, and some of us feel that
  we didn't get as much done as we wanted.
- We were glad about our teamwork being good which allowed us to get our features done well. We felt
  that people were pacing themselves well and getting their work done on time.
- Overall, from our Mad, Sad, Glad, we can see that our team is mostly glad about things and that the
  main issues are ones with communication/clarity or procrastination.
