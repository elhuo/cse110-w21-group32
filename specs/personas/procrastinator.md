## Overall Description
Tim is a freshman at the University of California, Los Angeles. He studies human biology and is planning to be pre-med. He wants to volunteer at a hospital to get more experience in the medical field, but he cannot get the motivation to start applying to hospitals. He is struggling with the transition to college classes and is getting overwhelmed by the workload. On his first quarter, he got a 2.5 GPA and was very disappointed. He's hoping to bring his GPA up in his next few quarters at UCLA.

He grew up in a lower-middle class first generation family in the Bay Area suburbs and breezed through his high school classes. He never developed good study habits because he didn't need to study for his classes before college. He was moderately active in high school organizations and was the treasurer for his school's Key Club.

## User Stories
- As a freshman, I want a pomodoro work schedule so that I can fix my study habits and bring up my GPA.
- As a pre-med student, I want to divide my work into pomos so that I can focus on studying for classes and applying to volunteer at hospitals without getting overwhelmed.
- As a gamer, I want to have longer breaks between completed pomos so that I can play for a long enough time without getting too worried about the timer going off soon.
