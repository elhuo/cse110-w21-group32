# [short title of solved problem and solution]

## Context and Problem Statement

On viewing some other teams' timers, we thought a 0-4 counter for the pomos until the long break would be a *cool* addition.

## Considered Options

* Include a pomo counter
* Do not include

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Include a pomo counter", because we can make it fit with the minimalist ice theme.

### Positive Consequences

* User has an idea of how many pomos they've done/have until the next long break, which is especially important with the cycles being automatically switched between.
* "Ice cube tray" fits with the minimalist ice theme
* Having a counter helps the user gage what pomo they're on

### Negative Consequences

* Makes the UI just a little more cluttered
