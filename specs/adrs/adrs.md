 ## Decisions
 * Pitch Decisions:
  -Decided our problem would revolve around students with poor habits or inexperience with work as this is a large target audience
  -Decided our apettite would be the time remaining from the creation of our pitch until the end of the quarter (4 weeks)
  -Rabbit holes will include any problems-solutions that we may address having to do w/ target audience

* C4 Decisions:
  -Created provisional containers and components (as opposed to those set in stone) to have an idea of any features we want to follow through with given we have the time to do so 
  
* Interface Design Decisions
   - Set the colors of the different stages
   - Deleted the background color change option 2/6/2021
