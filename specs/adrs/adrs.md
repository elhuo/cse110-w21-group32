## Essential Features MVP - MVP Sprint 1
* start button 
  ``` Begins the session. Button is disabled after clicked so that only the stop button may be pressed``` 
* stop button
 ``` Ends the session, does not pause, pressing stop will reset the time. Button is disabled after clicked so that only the start button may be pressed```
* Time
 ``` Contains the countdown of the current pomodoro stage(25min/15min/5min) in a 00:00 format. Shows the user how much time is left for each stage```
* Help Button
 ``` This is a static mockup page. Includes basic explaination of the pomodoro features as well as the summary of the benefits of using a pomodoro ```
 - Reason: to state the benefits and a simple how to use the pomodoro timer
* Three tabs
 ``` to change between the three stages: Pomo, Short Break, Long Break. The three stages are switched *automatically* when the current stage's timer goes to 00:00 and the tab of whatever stage you are on is highlighted. ```
 - Reason: Indicate what stage the user is in
  * Break
 ``` Every four pomos you get a longbreak(15min), after each individual pomo that is not the fourth pomo you receive a short break(5min)```
 
 ``` After a break, you have to press start again to start another pomo```
 
 ## Essential Add-ons -MVP Sprint 2
 * Browser Notification
 ``` Sound alert to notify when the pomo is finished.```
 - Reason: users probably won't be on the page of the pomodoro timer so the sound alert will notify them that we are switching stages
 * Settings
 ``` Adjusting the volume of the Browser Notification```
  - Reason: users will want to adjust the volume of their notification sound depending on their own preferences
 
## Add-ons - Stretch Sprint
 * Settings
  ```change time amount per stage (dropdown), change notification sound (dropdown similar to lab)```
  - Reason: customizing time amount per stage 
  
## Possible Add-ons
  * Adding a user log-in database
    - Reason: Track user tasks and completed pomos; this ties in with the concept of gamification and the sense of accomplishment from completing pomos and being able to plan own time when seeing task list.
    
 
 ## Decisions
 * Pitch Decisions:
  -Decided our problem would revolve around students with poor habits or inexperience with work as this is a large target audience
  -Decided our apettite would be the time remaining from the creation of our pitch until the end of the quarter (4 weeks)
  -Rabbit holes will include any problems-solutions that we may address having to do w/ target audience

* C4 Decisions:
  -Created provisional containers and components (as opposed to those set in stone) to have an idea of any features we want to follow through with given we have the time to do so 
  
* Interface Design Decisions
   - Set the colors of the different stages
   - Deleted the background color change option 2/6/2021
     - No need to complicate the background color change since users won't even be looking at this page all the time
   
* Pipeline Decisions
## Status: 
Outline: Lint -> Commit -> Build -> Test -> Deploy

### Linting:
Install VSCode extensions on every individualâ€™s VSCode environment and run locally:

 - VSCode Extensions:

 - ESLint: JS

 - LintHTML: HTML

 - CSS Formatter: CSS

We could not get the automated linting in Github Actions to work but we decided on using VSCode extensions (the three above). Everyone on the team will install these extensions locally and will use them for formatting and linting.

- Code Commit: 
  - GitHub commit to dev branch for review. Branch flow: dev-> test -> main
  - We will be pushing code into the dev branch and then test and then finally the deploy stage which is main branch.

- Build:
  - Pull Requests:
    -  User review of documentation and code quality using automated tool [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/product). Codacy generates feedback on our pull requests for code quality.

- Documentation:
  - Documentation generated by [JSDocs](https://jsdoc.app/) in Github Actions. Currently, can't get it to work but will make developers comment and make documentation on their own code for now.

- Testing:
  - Unit tests set up by code developer that developed the code themselves and using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to test code.

- Deploy:
  - Review code by another developer and the team.

### Best Practices

* CSS Best Practices
 - 
* JS Best Practices
  - Avoid Global Variables
  - Always Declare Local Variables
    - All variables used in a function should be declared as local variables.
    - Local variables must be declared with the var keyword or the let keyword, otherwise they will become global variables.
  - Declarations on Top and Initialize Variables
  - Don't Use new Object()
    - Use {} instead of new Object()
    - Use "" instead of new String()
    - Use 0 instead of new Number()
    - Use false instead of new Boolean()
    - Use [] instead of new Array()
    - Use /()/ instead of new RegExp()
    - Use function (){} instead of new Function()
