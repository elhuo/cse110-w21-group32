* Pipeline Decisions

# DISCLAIMER: We had to rename all files to fit the naming format. As a result, creation dates may not match the actual time of ADR creation.

## Status: 
Outline: Lint -> Commit -> Build -> Test -> Deploy
Branch: name/issue#

### Linting:
Install VSCode extensions on every individual’s VSCode environment and run locally:

 - VSCode Extensions:

 - ESLint: JS

 - LintHTML: HTML

 - CSS Formatter: CSS

We could not get the automated linting in Github Actions to work but we decided on using VSCode extensions (the three above). Everyone on the team will install these extensions locally and will use them for formatting and linting.

- Code Commit: 
  - GitHub commit to dev branch for review. Branch flow: dev-> test -> main
  - We will be pushing code into the dev branch and then test and then finally the deploy stage which is main branch.

- Build:
  - Make feature branches(can make pull requests easier)
  - Pull Requests:
    -  User review of documentation and code quality using automated tool [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/product). Codacy generates feedback on our pull requests for code quality.

- Documentation:
  - Documentation generated by [JSDocs](https://jsdoc.app/) in Github Actions. Currently, can't get it to work but will make developers comment and make documentation on their own code for now.

- Testing:
  - Unit tests set up by code developer that developed the code themselves and using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to test code.

- Deploy:
  - Review code by another developer and the team.

### Best Practices

* CSS Best Practices
 - Use flexible/relative units
 - Avoid overriding
 - Formatting:
   - Include a space between the selector(s) and the opening curly brace.
   - Always include a semi-colon at the end of the last declaration, even though it isn't strictly necessary.
   - Put the closing curly brace on a new line.
   - In each declaration, put a space after the separating colon, but not before.
   - Use 2 spaces for code indentation.
 - Favor longhand rules over terse shorthand
 - Use double quotes around values
 - CSS comments, comment sections through ```/*----Section Name-----*/```
 - Don't use !important
 - Don't use ID selectors
 
 
* JS Best Practices
  - Avoid Global Variables
  - Always Declare Local Variables
    - All variables used in a function should be declared as local variables.
    - Local variables must be declared with the var keyword or the let keyword, otherwise they will become global variables.
  - Declarations on Top and Initialize Variables
  - Don't Use new Object()
    - Use {} instead of new Object()
    - Use "" instead of new String()
    - Use 0 instead of new Number()
    - Use false instead of new Boolean()
    - Use [] instead of new Array()
    - Use /()/ instead of new RegExp()
    - Use function (){} instead of new Function()
    
    
    - Dev branch: writing code and testing your own code
      - Every developer tests their own code using jest and pushes to the dev branch
      - Comment and document your own code during the dev branch state
      - Decisions made will be added to the ADR and every developer should stay updated with the ADR before they start developing
    - Test branch: manual team code review
    - Main branch: final merging and deployment
