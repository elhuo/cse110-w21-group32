# [Tasklist Decisions]

* Status: [rejected]
* Deciders: [whole team] 
* Date: [2021-03-21 when the decision was last updated and status changed from accepted to rejected]

## Context and Problem Statement
We originally wanted to have a tasks list feature where users can add tasks and mark them as done when they finish.

## Decision Outcome
We decided to not implement this feature as from the user perspective, it is not as useful and after evaluation, we think that the cons overweigh the pros.

### Positive Consequences
- pros:
  - help keep track of tasks
  - feel accomplished
  
### Negative Consequences
- cons:
  - clustered UI
  - most users probably already have their own to-do list
  - setting the pomo time for specific tasks is not as useful
