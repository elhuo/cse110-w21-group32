# [Branches with too many commits]

* Status: [accepted]
* Deciders: [whole team] 

## Context and Problem Statement

We originally had only three branches dev->test->main and this ended up being really bad because there were too many commits, really hard to code review and make pull requests.

## Considered Options

* 1. Keep the current structure
* 2. Do individual feature branches


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Option 2", because this can focus a single branch on a single feature/issue and format of branch should be issue#/feature or issue name.
