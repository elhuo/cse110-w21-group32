# DISCLAIMER: We had to rename all files to fit the naming format. As a result, creation dates may not match the actual time of ADR creation.
# [Branches with too many commits]

* Status: [accepted]
* Deciders: [whole team] 

## Context and Problem Statement

We originally had only three branches dev->test->main and this ended up being really bad because there were too many commits, really hard to code review and make pull requests.
- Dev branch: writing code and testing your own code
  - Every developer tests their own code using jest and pushes to the dev branch
  - Comment and document your own code during the dev branch state
  - Decisions made will be added to the ADR and every developer should stay updated with the ADR before they start developing
- Test branch: manual team code review
- Main branch: final merging and deployment

## Considered Options

* 1. Keep the current structure
* 2. Do individual feature branches


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Option 2", because this can focus a single branch on a single feature/issue and format of branch should be issue#/feature or issue name.
Every week during team meeting merge pull requests.

### Linting:
Install VSCode extensions on every individualâ€™s VSCode environment and run locally:
 - VSCode Extensions:
   - ESLint: JS
   - LintHTML: HTML
   - CSS Formatter: CSS

### Code Commit: 
  - GitHub commit to dev branch for review. Branch flow: feature branches -> dev-> test -> main
  - We will be pushing code into the dev branch and then test and then finally the deploy stage which is main branch.

### Build:
  - Make feature branches(can make pull requests easier)
  - Pull Requests:
    -  User review of documentation and code quality using automated tool [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/product). Codacy generates feedback on our pull requests for code quality.

### Documentation:
  - Documentation generated by [JSDocs](https://jsdoc.app/) in Github Actions. Currently, can't get it to work but will make developers comment and make documentation on their own code for now.

### Testing:
  - Unit tests set up by code developer that developed the code themselves and using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to test code.

### Deploy:
  - Review code by  the team.
