# Meeting with Chad 2-5-2021


Checkin and Feedback with Chad:

## Splice
Our Essential Features(MVP): Tasklist, Start button, Stop button, Tracking completed pomodoros in first sprint. 

## User Personas(Wilson & Eric):
Fleshed out personas from previous user stories.
Target: Students
Abilities: Technological abilities


(Add descriptions to these)
Personas should inform the user stories.
	For ex. A student who doesn’t procrastinate and time management is not an issue
For ex. A student who has trouble starting tasks on time and setting better time    management skills.
	Multiple user stories for each persona.

	

##UI(Elizabeth, Ellie, Nathan):	Task Input Field ← But not included in Project Roadmap(Chad)
	
We are having trouble with what is essential as opposed to what additional features we would like to include.


Keep in mind how we’re going to design things down the road. The min-point features in the same UI mockup. If we reference a feature in the UI mockups, we should plan for it to appear in the Project Roadmap. In Sprint 1. 2. Etc. Getting these things done in our realistic timetable.

## C4 System-Diagrams(Stephen, Elliot, Zane):
	### Level1(context):
		
	### Level2(container):
		Web Application: static content with (HTML, CSS)
Single Page Application: The functionality of the timer, buttons(start,stop), and possibly logging page





### Level3(Component):
		The JavaScript Component
		
		Notification after each session. 
		
		Feedback: Pretty Good
			    A couple of remaining pieces of functionality that is not sure to fit.
			    The Timer itself, Is it a separate component?
			    
			    Storing tasks, how will that be done?

Javascript needs to be incorporated into the timer to incr/decr. If the Timer and the broader systems to be one component, Chad suggests to split these components into more parts. 

A notification system is definitely an important component. 

We got to “massage” more on this.

			   How are we going to present a task internally? We have to define a common interface for these components. Some possibilities may result in disorganization and messy coding. 

## C4: Chad recommonds writing sentences as opposed to single word descriptions. 

Regarding Tasks: Can we justify the development costs for the tasks would prove that the developments would outweigh the development costs. Once we introduce tasks/statistics, We have to question: Ownership. Associating a task with a pomodoro, or a pomodoro with a task. What happens when someone leaves in the middle of a pomodoro. What may seem like a natural addition is not necessarily needed. Why our app vs. a todo app. Are we adding a feature for the sake of adding a feature?

Keep fleshing out the CI Diagrams, Mockups, UserPersonas(User Stories) make sure they are connected and that they are connected to the problem in the pitch. 

Breaking down the sprints into more granular issues. Create subtasks to assign to students. 

## The Pitch: Were presenting our project to our manager and trying to convince our manager that this project is worth working on. 

What does the help screen entail?

 How would we accomplish that. We have to be more specific on our tasks and logging.( Is this a rabbit hole we're entering?).
