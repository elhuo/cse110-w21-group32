# [Tabs Decisions]

* Status: [accepted]
* Deciders: [whole team] 

## Context and Problem Statement
We originally had all three stages with tabs but that made it look like the tabs are clickable.

## Considered Options

* 1. Keep the current design
* 2. Only have tab on current stage
* 3. Get rid of tabs

## Decision Outcome
We decided to go with option 2 and only have the tab outline for the current stage the user was on so it will still indicate which stage the user is in without making it look like you can click on the tabs and manually switch stages.
