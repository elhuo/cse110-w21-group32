# [short title of solved problem and solution]

## Context and Problem Statement

Had no ways of viewing how many total pomos you'd completed in a given session (page openned to close or reset).

## Decision Outcome

Added small text counter to the bottom of the page to keep track of the total pomos completed in a given session.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Gives the user a way to know how many pomos they've completed.
* Makes bug testing just a bit easier.

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Adds to the clutter of the page, which is opposed to the otherwise minimalist layout.
