## User Stories
- As a double-major, I want the time spreadout of a pomodoro time to try out new simple ways to focus and study for long periods of time, as well as divide my work.
- As a busy student, I want breaks while working to make more time for myself and have fun with my hobbies while still being productive.
- As a senior, I want a set period of interrupted work to prepare for the transition from being a student to working a full-time job.
